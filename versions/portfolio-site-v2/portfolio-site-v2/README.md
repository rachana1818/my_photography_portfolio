## 🖼 Adding Your Photos

### 1. Profile photo (About section + Nav avatar)

Place your photo at `images/me.jpg`, then update:

```html
<!-- About section — find this block and replace the src -->
<div class="your-photo-circle">
  <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Your Name — Photographer" />
</div>

<!-- Nav avatar — find this and replace the placeholder div -->
<div class="nav-avatar">
  <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Your Name" />
</div>
```

### 2. Hero photo (main big image on the right)

Place your best shot at `images/hero.jpg`, then find:

```html
<div class="hero-photo-main">
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/..." alt="Portrait photography" />
```

Replace the `src` with:
```html
  <img src="images/hero.jpg" alt="Portrait photography" />
```

### 3. Gallery photos

Place your gallery photos in `images/` and update each masonry item. For each photo, update **both** the `data-src` (used for the lightbox) and the `src` (thumbnail):

```html
<div class="masonry-item reveal" data-src="images/photo1.jpg">
  <img src="images/photo1.jpg" alt="Portrait" loading="lazy"/>
  <div class="masonry-overlay"><span>Your Caption ↗</span></div>
</div>
```

You can add or remove as many `masonry-item` blocks as you like.

---

## 💰 Updating Prices

Find the Services section in `index.html` and update the `.s-price` divs:

```html
<div class="s-price">Starting at ₹2,500</div>
```

Change the currency symbol (₹) and amount to match your pricing.

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- **Code editor:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free)
- **Git GUI (optional):** [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) — easier than command line
- **Image optimisation:** Compress your photos at [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app) before uploading (keeps the site fast)
- **Recommended photo size:** Max 1200px wide, under 300KB each

---

## 📬 Contact Form Note

The contact form currently shows a success message on submit but **does not actually send emails** — it's UI only. To make it fully functional, consider connecting it to a free service like:

- [Formspree](https://formspree.io) — just change the form action, free tier available
- [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) — easy setup, no backend needed

Made with 🌿 and lots of love for photography.
